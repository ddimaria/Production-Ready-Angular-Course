# Generate Blueprints

There are many pre-built blueprints in the CLI for generating code:

Scaffold    | Usage
---         | ---
Component   | `ng g component COMPONENT-NAME`
Directive   | `ng g directive DIRECTIVE-NAME`
Pipe        | `ng g pipe PIPE-NAME`
Service     | `ng g service SERVICE-NAME`
Class       | `ng g class CLASS-NAME`
Guard       | `ng g guard GUARD-NAME`
Interface   | `ng g interface INTERFACE-NAME`
Enum        | `ng g enum ENUM-NAME`
Module      | `ng g module MODULE-NAME`

To read all of the available options for each blueprint, visit the Angular CLI Wiki on GitHub: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki

`ng g` is a shortcut for `ng generate`

There are many other commands available other than `generate`, many of which will be covered in other Units/Modules.
